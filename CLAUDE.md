Always review shaders/_ShaderToy_HowTo.mdc for shader editing and audio/audio_effect_instructions.md for audio effect editing.

# Audio Effects
- Audio effects are SuperCollider (.sc) files in the audio/ folder
- Effect name must match filename (e.g. test.sc uses defName = \test)
- When renaming effects: rename file AND update defName variable AND update postln message
